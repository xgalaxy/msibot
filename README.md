# MSI Buy Bot

### Purpose
This is a jank MSI store autobuy bot I wrote to get a NVIDIA 5090.

This bot worked and I got what I needed. I last tested it on 03/04/2025.
I will not be supporting it or making further changes.

### More Info
I don't know typescript / web dev all that well so I'm sure a lot of this is crap.

Not designed to run on as a service. It won't handle captchas automatically. But it will feed stdin for the login captcha.

It does not use proxies so you can't spam the shit out of their store without getting blocked.
It would be fairly easy to get it setup with proxies though.
